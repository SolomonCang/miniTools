Some mini tools for my research

tess_gaia_ps.py: 
  This a command-line tool to quick check the power spectrum of a star with GAIA ID, especially for a white dwarf, with the TESS lightcurve. It can be use for other targets by adjusting the range of period (default 50-2000s). 
  To use it, just run 'python tess_gaia_ps.py 1394045267867814400' in the command line, the number can be replaced by any Gaia ID.
